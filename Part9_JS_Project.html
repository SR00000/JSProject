    <h1>Welcome to Part 8: Your JavaScript Level One Project!</h1>
    <p>For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to
      ask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are looking for
      a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a series of questions,
      only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect. If all
      questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in console
      for the Spy to read!
   </p>


  <p>A spy with the following information should see your secret message:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jose Johnson</li>
    <li>26 years old</li>
    <li>175 cm tall</li>
    <li>Pet name is "Sammy"</li>
  </ul>
